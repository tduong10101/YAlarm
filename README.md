# YAlarm
Basic alarm App created to re-learn Python, project idea from [link](https://www.reddit.com/r/beginnerprojects/comments/4n9hne/project_idea_alarm_clock/)
## Getting Started:
YAlarm using Tkinter to provide an UI for users to set alarms. Once set time is reach, it will open a website base on link supplied by user.
If there's no link supplied or link error, YAlarm will open this [youtube video](https://youtu.be/WVP3fUzQHcg).

If time set is already past, YAlarm will set the time for next day
